Captum is a flexible easy-to-use model interpretability library for PyTorch, providing state-of-the-art tools for understanding how specific neurons and layers affect predictions.

## Installation

Captum can be install using either Conda or Pip:

```bash
conda install captum -c pytorch
or
pip install captum
```
